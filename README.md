# Social-Media
This is a Django project for my University course 'Python Programming'

## Project idea
Building a social media in which users can post pictures, follow other users, like their posts. All users can delete and eidt their posts.

## How to run the project
Download this repo and after that run `python manage.py runserver` and the app should be running on port 8000.
